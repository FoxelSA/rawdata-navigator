_rawdata-navigator_ is a web-based human-understandable interface dedicated to navigate
through raw datasets. It draws downloaded segments on a map and a timeline, allowing
to display information (geoposition, orientation, status, date and preview) for every pose of the
segments. Segments can also be viewed as timelapse videos, where every frame is binded
to its pose information.
